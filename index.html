    Once published, this file will map to https://github.com/crim-ca/crim-ca.github.io/blob/main/js/schema-listing.js
    Which should be resolved to https://crim-ca.github.io/js/schema-listing.js
    It will automatically resolve all available schema versions found on the 'gh-pages' branch
    under 'crim-ca' repositories, for the corresponding repository name used as prefix path, 
    i.e.: 'https://crim-ca.github.io/{REPO_NAME}/vX.Y.Z/schema.json'.
